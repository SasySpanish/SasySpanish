Napoli, Italy 🇮🇹 | Stats & Finance 

### A bit about me
I’m a freshly graduated quantitative analyst (MSc in Statistical, Actuarial and Financial Sciences) with interests in financial, energy and insurance markets, risk management, and anything that mixes statistics with real-world problems.

During the day I’ve been workin glass across the Amalfi Coast (yes, the real italian experience 🚛), in the evenings and weekends I’ve been teaching myself and applying Python, R, and a bit of machine learning to financial and economic questions.

I love clean code, clear visualizations, and models that actually make sense in practice.

Languages: Italian (native) • English (solid B2, happy to chat or write)

### What you'll find here

🔹 **Brent-VaR-ML**  
   My master’s thesis project. Estimating Value at Risk on Brent crude oil prices using both classic statistical methods and machine learning (Random Forests, XGBoost, Neural Networks). Spoiler: ML can be competitive, but it’s not magic.

🔹 **Financial-Data-Analysis-Automation**  
   A personal toolbox that downloads data from Yahoo Finance, cleans it, calculates returns/indicators, and plots everything nicely. Basically the thing I wish existed when I started.

🔹 **Poverty-Italy-Geospatial-Analysis** (Poverty in Italy – Geographical Data Analysis)  
   Exploring poverty indicators across Italian provinces with R: maps, spatial regression, Moran’s I… because poverty is not randomly distributed.


+ a few smaller experiments and university assignments.

### Tools I use daily
- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, tensorflow, yfinance, matplotlib/seaborn)
- R (still love it for stats and quick geospatial stuff)
- Excel + VBA (yes, really)
